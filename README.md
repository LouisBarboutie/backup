# Backup

Because Windows backup sucks, I wrote this helper script to back up my files. 
When Windows backup fails, no further information is available from the settings 
pane, whereas this script has the goal to be more explicit. 

It can be scheduled from the Task Scheduler to run in regular intervals and 
seems to run faster than Windows backup, as it doesn't save all the junk data 
from Windows.
